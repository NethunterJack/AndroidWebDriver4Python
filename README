AndroidWebDriver4Python is an add-on to Selenium Python Client Driver.
Its source code could be found from 
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py

As I could not find Android WebDriver implementation in it,
and I really like Python as opposed to Java. So I want to implement one.

Installing
============

As I am a newbie, I do not expect to commit in the Selenium project.
To install this AndroidDriver for Python, you need:
1. download and extract Python client from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium#downloads
2. download AndroidWebDriver4Python from using git clone git://github.com/truebit/AndroidWebDriver4Python.git
3. navigate to ../selenium-2.x.x/py/selenium/webdriver
4. copy the entire folder of android under AndroidWebDriver4Python to above
directory
5. add one line in file __init__.py in directory that was mentioned in step 3:
    from android.webdriver import WebDriver as Android
   put this line besides other similiar looked lines
6. back to the root directory of Selenium Python Client, to install this
modified version using command:
    python setup.py setup

Here you have installed this AndroidWebDriver4Python add-on.
There are some prerequisites to use AndroidWebDriver4Python.

7. Install Android SDK and set 'tools' and 'platform-tools' in your PATH:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

8. Install Android server side application on your device:
    Download android-server-2.x.x.apk from 
    http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list

9. enable 'USB Debugging' in your device, which normally could found from:
    Settings>Applications>Development>USB debugging

10. connect USB cable between device and PC, install adb drivers
