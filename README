AndroidWebDriver4Python is an add-on to Selenium Python Client Driver.
Its source code could be found from 
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py

As I could not find Android WebDriver implementation in it,
and I really like Python as opposed to Java. So I want to implement one.

More infomation about Selenium, plz check http://code.google.com/p/selenium/

Installing
============

As I am a newbie, I do not expect to commit in the Selenium project.
To install this AndroidDriver for Python, you need:
1. download and extract Python client from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium#downloads
2. download AndroidWebDriver4Python from using git clone git://github.com/truebit/AndroidWebDriver4Python.git
4. copy the entire 'py' folder under AndroidWebDriver4Python to merge the
same one in root directory of AndroidDriver for Python
5. back to the root directory of Selenium Python Client, to install this
modified version using command:
    python setup.py install

Here you have installed this AndroidWebDriver4Python add-on.
There are some prerequisites to use AndroidWebDriver4Python.

6. Install Android SDK and set 'tools' and 'platform-tools' in your PATH:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

7. Install Android server side application on your device:
    Download android-server-2.x.x.apk from 
    http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list

8. enable 'USB Debugging' in your device, which normally could found from:
    Settings>Applications>Development>USB debugging

9. connect USB cable between device and PC, install adb drivers

For more information you could check
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list,but you do not need to do all
those steps. Above 3 steps is all you need to do.

Example
============

from selenium import webdriver

driver= webdriver.Android()
#another way is to explicitly specify the serial id of the device
#driver=webdriver.Android('emulator-5554')
driver.get("http://www.symbio.com")
driver.quit()
